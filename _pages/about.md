I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Spatial Economics department of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute. I am studying the **regional economic effects of decarbonisation**, focusing on the **required investments in new technologies and the energy system** and **labour market effects**. I do so using (S)CGE modelling, input-output modelling and theoretical models.

In addition to this, I work as a guest researcher at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). My supervisors are Prof. Dr. Henri de Groot, Dr. Gerard van der Meijden and external supervisor Dr. Olga Ivanova (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency). 

Additionally, I organize the internal brown-bag seminars of the Spatial Economics department at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Eureka seminars), and I am a board member of the WO&MEN Network at the VU.
