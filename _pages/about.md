I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Spatial Economics department of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute. I am studying the **regional economic effects of decarbonisation**, focusing on the **required investments in new technologies** and **labour market effects**. 

My supervisors are Prof. Dr. Henri de Groot, Dr. Gerard van der Meijden and external supervisor Dr. Olga Ivanova (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency). 

Additionally, I organize the internal brown-bag seminars of the Spatial Economics department at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Eureka seminars), and I am a board member of the WO&MEN Network at the VU.
