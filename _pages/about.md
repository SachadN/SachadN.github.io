I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Spatial Economics department of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute. I am studying the **regional economic effects of decarbonisation**, focusing on the **required investments in new technologies and the energy system** and **labour market effects**. I do so using (S)CGE modelling, input-output modelling, theoretical models and survey techniques. My supervisors are Prof. Dr. Henri de Groot and Dr. Gerard van der Meijden. 

In addition to this, I work as a guest researcher at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), where I contributed on similar research studying the Dutch provinces and where I am involved in modelling long-term scenarios using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.
