I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Spatial Economics department of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute. I am studying the regional economic effects of decarbonisation, focusing on the required investments in new technologies and labour market effects. My supervisors are Prof. Dr. Henri de Groot, Dr. Gerard van der Meijden and external supervisor Dr. Olga Ivanova (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency).
